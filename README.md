# vphone-cli

Boot a virtual iPhone via Apple's Virtualization.framework using PCC research VM infrastructure.

![poc](./docs/demo.jpeg)

## Prerequisites

**Host:**

- Apple Silicon
- macOS 15+ (Sequoia)
- Xcode + iOS SDK (cross-compiles the guest daemon)
- [SIP/AMFI relaxation to allow private PV=3 entitlements with unsigned-binary](#sipamfi-relaxation)

**Dependencies:**

```bash
brew install python@3.13 aria2 wget gnu-tar openssl@3 ldid-procursus sshpass libusb ipsw zstd
```

## Install

```bash
brew install zqxwce/tap/vphone-cli
```

## Build

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli.git

./scripts/setup_tools.sh      # install deps, build toolchain submodules, create the Python venv
./scripts/build.sh            # build + sign vphone-cli, bundle the .app, cross-compile vphoned

cd .build/vphone-cli.app/Contents/MacOS/
vphone-cli --help
```

## Quick Start

One command creates a VM end-to-end (download → patch → DFU restore → CFW install → first boot):

```bash
vphone-cli vm create myphone -V jb        # -V / --variant

vphone-cli vm launch myphone
```

## Commands

`vphone-cli vm create` runs the whole pipeline; the individual steps below let you drive it manually or re-run one stage.

### Manage

```bash
vphone-cli vm list                         # list VMs (--json for scripting)
vphone-cli vm info myphone                  # show one VM
vphone-cli vm new myphone                   # create an empty bundle (cpu/mem/disk options)
vphone-cli vm config myphone --cpu 8 --memory 8192
vphone-cli vm clone myphone myphone-2       # fast APFS clone, fresh device identity
vphone-cli vm export myphone --out myphone.tzst   # zstd fast by default (--max = xz -9); --out may be a dir (auto-names <vm>.tzst/.txz); skips restore dir + staging files
vphone-cli vm import myphone.tzst --name restored
vphone-cli vm rename myphone iphone16
vphone-cli vm delete iphone16
```

### Build a VM manually (what `vm create` automates)

```bash
vphone-cli vm new myphone                              # 1. empty bundle
vphone-cli fw prepare myphone --iphone-version 26.1     # 2. download + merge IPSWs
vphone-cli fw patch myphone --variant jb                # 3. patch the boot chain

vphone-cli vm launch myphone --dfu &                    # 4. boot into DFU (background)
vphone-cli restore myphone --get-shsh                   #    fetch SHSH
vphone-cli restore myphone                              #    DFU restore
vphone-cli vm stop myphone                              #    stop the DFU boot

vphone-cli cfw install myphone --variant jb             # 5. install CFW (host-mount; asks for sudo)
vphone-cli vm launch myphone                            # 6. first boot
```

Update to a newer iOS by pointing `fw prepare` at an IPSW: `--iphone-source /path/to.ipsw --cloudos-source /path/to.ipsw`.

## Firmware Variants

Five patch variants with increasing security bypass — pass one to `--variant`:

| Variant      | Boot Chain  | CFW       | Notes                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `less`       | 4 patches   | 2 phases  | Patchless — keeps iOS mitigations enabled                         |
| `regular`    | 42 patches  | 10 phases | AMFI/SSV/Img4/TXM bypass                                           |
| `dev`        | 53 patches  | 12 phases | + TXM entitlement/debug bypass                                    |
| `jb`         | 113 patches | 14 phases | + full jailbreak (Sileo, TrollStore auto-install on first boot)   |
| `exp`        | 141 patches | 18 phases | JB superset + anti-VM-detection research patches                  |

See [`research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md`](./research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md) for the per-component breakdown.

## Running & Connecting

- **SSH (jailbreak):** `ssh -p 22222 mobile@<vm-ip>` (password `alpine`)
- **SSH (regular/dev):** `ssh -p 22222 root@<vm-ip>`
- **VNC:** `vnc://<vm-ip>:5901`

## Locations

Everything vphone-cli creates lives under `~/.vphone/` — kept outside the repo and the `.app` so the signed bundle stays portable. Redirect the whole tree with `$VPHONE_ROOT`:

| Path              | Contents                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.vphone/`      | The per-user data root — override the entire location with `$VPHONE_ROOT`.                   |
| `~/.vphone/VMs/`  | VM bundles — one directory per VM. This is the library; override with `$VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT`. |
| `~/.vphone/ipsws/`| Downloaded iPhone + cloudOS IPSWs, cached and reused across VMs.                              |
| `~/.vphone/tools/`| Cached APFS seal-volume artifacts (`apfs_sealvolume_<version>`) fetched during `fw prepare`.  |
| `~/.vphone/debs/` | Cached `.deb` packages the `jb`/`exp` CFW install lays into the guest (Sileo, apt, …).        |
| `~/.vphone/venv/` | Auto-provisioned Python environment (see [Python runtime](#python-runtime); override with `$VPHONE_VENV_DIR`). |

Precedence: the per-item overrides (`$VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT`, `$VPHONE_VENV_DIR`) win over `$VPHONE_ROOT`, which wins over the `~/.vphone` default. The `ipsws/`, `tools/`, and `debs/` caches always sit directly under whichever root is active.

## SIP/AMFI Relaxation

**Option A — fully disable SIP, then disable AMFI via boot-arg (most permissive).** 

In Recovery (long-press power → Terminal):

```bash
csrutil disable
csrutil allow-research-guests enable
```

Then reboot into macOS and set the AMFI boot-arg (needs SIP fully off to take effect):

```bash
sudo nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 -v"   # reboot after
```

**Option B — keep SIP on (debug-only relaxed) and let `vphone-cli` open a window per launch** (leaves AMFI enabled the rest of the time).

In Recovery:

```bash
csrutil enable --without debug
csrutil allow-research-guests enable
```

Then reboot into macOS. There is nothing else to set up: `vphone-cli` carries
no entitlements and always launches, so when it starts a guest it notices that
amfid will not accept `vphone-vm`, opens a window with `vphone-letmein` (one
sudo prompt), and closes it once the guest is running.

> **Check this before relying on Option B:**
>
> ```bash
> sysctl vm.cs_system_enforcement    # must be 0
> ```
>
> `vphone-letmein` opens its window by writing into amfid's `__TEXT`, which
> makes that page private, dirty and unsigned. If the host enforces code
> signing system-wide, the kernel validates the page the next time amfid faults
> into it, finds no signature, and kills amfid —
> `CODESIGNING / "Invalid Page"`, with a report in
> `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`. The guest is killed too, because amfid
> died before it answered. Measured on macOS 27.0 (26A428), arm64e, with
> exactly the `csrutil` settings above: the sysctl reads **1**, so Option B
> does not work there and `vphone-letmein` refuses rather than taking amfid
> down. The sysctl is read-only, so nothing can relax it at runtime.

> `csrutil enable --without debug` by itself does **not** clear it — that flag
> buys `task_for_pid`, not permission to run modified pages. If the sysctl
> reads 1, use Option A; with AMFI relaxed, `vphone-vm` launches on its own and
> `vphone-letmein` is not involved at all.
>
> The predecessor `amfidont` worked under enforcement because it drove amfid
> through LLDB, and a debugger sets arm64 breakpoints in the CPU's debug
> registers without writing to the page. Doing that here needs
> `com.apple.private.set-exception-port` and
> `com.apple.private.thread-set-state`, which is why `vphone-letmein` patches
> instead — and why the patch carries this precondition.

To do it by hand — worth it while working on `vphone-vm`, where one sudo beats
a prompt per run:

```bash
make letmein          # open        (sudo)
make letmein_status   # check
make letmein_off      # close
```

> **Be honest about what this does.** It is a global switch, not an allowlist:
> while the window is open, amfid reports *every* signature it checks as valid
> and Apple-signed. That cannot be narrowed to one path or one binary — a
> per-validation decision needs Apple-private debugger entitlements. What can
> be narrowed is time, which is why the automatic path holds the window only
> for the length of one launch. It is also memory-only: a reboot clears it.
>
> `vphone-letmein` replaces the old `amfidont` helper, which was a pip package
> and is no longer used. It is not a drop-in replacement: see the
> `vm.cs_system_enforcement` note above for the case `amfidont` covered and
> this does not.

## FAQ

**`zsh: killed ./vphone-vm`** — AMFI/debug restrictions aren't bypassed; see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) (`amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1`, or let `vphone-cli` open a window for you). Note this cannot happen to `vphone-cli` itself: it carries no entitlements, so if *it* is being killed, something else is wrong.

**`Virtualization is not available on this hardware`** — your Mac is itself a VM; PV=3 guest boot can't nest. Use a non-nested macOS 15+ host.

**Stuck on "Press home to continue"** — connect via VNC and right-click (two-finger click) to simulate the home button.

**System apps won't install** — during iOS setup, don't pick Japan or the EU as your region (extra regulatory checks the VM can't satisfy); pick e.g. United States.

**App crashes on launch with `EXC_GUARD` / `GUARD_TYPE_MACH_PORT`** — re-patch with `vphone-cli fw patch <name> --variant <v> --force-exc-guard`, then re-restore/install ([#291](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/issues/291)). Always on for iOS 18 bases.

**Install a `.ipa`/`.tipa`** — use the running VM's Install menu (drag-drop or file picker).

**`cfw install` hangs re-signing a system binary (e.g. `Campo`), memory climbing unbounded** — known bug in `ldid-procursus` up to `2.1.5-procursus7` (the current Homebrew `stable`): `bytes(uint64_t)` calls `__builtin_clzll(0)` with no zero-guard, which is undefined behavior, and on this build resolves to a `0`-length that underflows an unsigned loop counter — `ldid` spins writing one byte at a time into a growing buffer instead of terminating. Triggered by *any* entitlements plist containing an integer value of exactly `0` (some real Apple system binaries have these). Fixed upstream but not yet in a tagged release; rebuild from source: `brew install --HEAD ldid-procursus && brew link --overwrite ldid-procursus`. Kill the hung `ldid` process first (`sudo kill -9 <pid>`) if you already hit it.

## Automation

`vphone-cli` exposes a host control socket (`<bundle>/vphone.sock`) for programmatic control — screenshots, touch, swipes, hardware keys, clipboard — each action returning an inline screenshot for AI-driven E2E testing. See [vphone-mcp](https://github.com/pluginslab/vphone-mcp) for an MCP server wrapping it.
